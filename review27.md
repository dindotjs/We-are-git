i. Interest of Content
    The content is interesting but it is quite sparse. Most claims are also unsources, not even a quick hyperlink which would be nice. The topics are also well varied with little overlap so they cover a wide range.

ii. Consistency and quality of visual presentation
    The website a good common theme that is carried throughout, and the colour is nice (rosh likes the green). However, the theme is a bit dissonant with the content - the website presents itself as quite silly but the content is supposed to be factual. Also all the pages present the content in different structures, which isn't bad but it makes the website look less cohesive.
    The healthcare also doesn't have a header at all, just hyperlinks at the top of the page, and the two other pages' headers have inconsistent themes.
    The spacing between the dropdown boxes on the healthcare page is also a little odd as there is no gap between the dropdown box and the next button - also does this content need to be in a dropdown box? It is the main content of the page.

iii. Quality of written presentation
    The written content is quite sparse

iv. Validity of HTML
    Rosh & Brian could not find any mistakes in the HTML. It's well structured and presented. The only gripe we have is to why the index.html has it's own styles in the header when you guys have a global styles.css file, and so far as we can tell, they don't conflict at all.

v. Evidence of collaboration
    Looking at the git blame, we can tell that the pages were collaborated on. Different people made the content, CSS files, added bootstrap, helped structure pages, and the authorship was (on the most part) added by different people - the only exception was the home page.
