            Electronic health records have revolutionised how healthcare workers and patients access their data, it allows for instantanious access for a lifetime of health records for any healthcare worker without having to search through physical files.
            This allows for quicker access to healthcare and important information such as allergies or ongoing health issues to help provide the best care available without delay.

            computers have not only allowed for quicker and more detailed scans such as MRI and CAT scans, but they have also allowed for easier reading and analysis of these scans.
            For example with the help of AI scans can now be read and flagged to healthcare workers which can mean things which may have been missed are more likely to be picked up and can be dealt with sooner.
            it also allows for zooming in and better representations of scans and stored digitally which allows for faster access and sharing of scans.

            Robitic Surgery allows for procedures which normally require large incisions to be completed using keyhone surgery which means quicker recovery times less scarring and also allows for more precise movements during surgery which can improve sucess rates and reduce complications.
            Robotic surgery also allows for a specialist to perform remote surgery which can mean patients which are far away from the specialist can still get the best care possible.

            Computers allow for modeling of complex biological systems which can help researchers understand diseases and develop new treatments.
            It also allows for simulations of drugs which means that you can have faster development as less time is spent synthesising drugs which will not be effective or have severe side effects.
            It also allows for simulation of disese spread which can help in planning public health responses.
